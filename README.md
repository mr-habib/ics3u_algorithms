# ICS3U_Functions

Your job is to implement the functions found in main.py

This autograder SHOULD work if you do all of your code correctly.

## Be sure to include
( ) Docstrings for each of the functions</br>
( ) ENSURE each answer is rounded to 2 decimal places (python has a ```round()``` function you may find useful!)</br>
( ) Make sure your functions all ```return``` something! If you simply print out the answer, you won't pass the tests.</br>
( ) Use google to find the formulae of the weird ones near the bottom (Hypervolume of a 4D sphere? There's a pretty easy formula :)

If you have any questoins, please ask!
